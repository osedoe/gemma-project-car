## Notes

This is a retrospective log entry to document work already completed. The floor patches are structural and critical for the integrity of the rear subframe mounting points. Proper rust removal and welding technique is essential for long-term durability.

The weld-through primer provides corrosion protection in the welded seams where traditional paint cannot reach.
