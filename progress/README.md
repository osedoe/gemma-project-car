# Progress Tracking

Track restoration tasks, milestones, and overall project progress.

## Files

- `current-tasks.md` - Active tasks being worked on
- `milestones.md` - Major project milestones and phases
- `completed-tasks.md` - Archive of completed tasks

## Workflow

1. Add new tasks to `current-tasks.md`
2. Update task status as you work
3. Move completed tasks to `completed-tasks.md`
4. Update `milestones.md` when major phases are completed
