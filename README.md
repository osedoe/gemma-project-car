## Project Background

Gemma was gifted as a rusty shell with an engine that hasn't started in at least 3 years. The goal is to restore her to original/OEM condition.

**Initial Condition:**
- Non-running for 3+ years
- Significant rust in rear floor and seat areas
- Interior stripped
- Some engine components present

**Current State:**
- Rusty floor sections cut out and patched with welded plates
- Patches currently have weld-through primer applied
- Car mostly empty except for some engine components
- Wiring harness removed (needs reinstallation)

## Restoration Objective

Full OEM restoration to bring Gemma back to original factory condition.
