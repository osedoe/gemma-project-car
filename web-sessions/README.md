# Claude Web Session Notes

This folder contains notes and updates from Claude Web sessions.

## File Naming Convention

Files should be named: `N-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Where:
- `N` is the session number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date

**Examples:**
- `1-2025-11-07.md` - First session on November 7, 2025
- `2-2025-11-07.md` - Second session on November 7, 2025
- `3-2025-11-08.md` - Third session on November 8, 2025

## Usage

1. Have your Claude Web session
2. Ask Claude Web to generate a markdown summary of the session
3. Download the file from Claude Web
4. Save it here with the appropriate number-date filename
5. Feed it to Claude Code when needed to sync information
